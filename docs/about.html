        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>As students, it is natural for us to strive for success academically but to get a chance to apply our excellence in the real world is our true goal. Our attention has been turned towards the growing problem of homelessness in Toronto. From attending Ryerson and constantly roaming the streets of the downtown core, we have seen way too many homeless people just lying on the streets begging for money, with no way to obtain free food for themselves. This issue has raised many concerns regarding health and nutrition, and the way people treat the homeless. Some have resulted to suicide as the only way out. Now with our web application, we are offering an alternative way out for the homeless people. Our website combines restaurant marketing incentives while offering free food availability location information via Google Map indicators. We also offer a 24 hour Chatbot service that assist those in need of someone to talk to.</p>
